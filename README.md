# Vipps Partner API

💥 **IMPORTANT!** 💥

This is the very first version, and `v0` means version zero,
and that there may be some (minor) changes before the first _official_ `v1` version.

The API is available for all partners using
[partner keys](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner#partner-keys).

Feedback is welcome!
Please try to use GitHub's
[issue](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner-api/issues)
functionality, so we can avoid multiple parallell discussions in various channels.
